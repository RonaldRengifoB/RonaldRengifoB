# Hey there, my name is Ronald Rengifo ðŸ‘‹
### I'm a Network Security & Cloud Engineer

I'm an IT professional with over ten years of experience working with infrastructure, both on-premise and cloud, always looking for ways to solve everyday problems and learn from them, from the basic but not-so-obvious to the most challenging ones.

My experience has led me to develop my skills in network design, deployment, administration, and Linux management including virtualization, containerization, and monitoring.

In the last couple of years, I discovered and started learning about the DevOps methodology and it grew my interest in Cloud Solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the future for delivering IT resources to companies and Network Security to keep that future promising.
